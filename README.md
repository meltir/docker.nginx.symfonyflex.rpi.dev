# docker.nginx.symfonyflex.rpi.dev
Preconfigured nginx image for symfony flex app 

Ready to run on a RPI (based on alpine), and preconfigured with folders ready to use 

Assumes there is a php-fpm instance running on a 'php' container, and that flex app is in /var/www/.

Includes config to run magento2 as well.

This is a personal toy, do not use this for anything unless you are willing to make it work for you.
